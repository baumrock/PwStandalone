The ProcessWire core has many great classes such as WireData, WireArray, WireRandom etc.; Many of them can be used without a running PW installation!

This repo helps testing those features and hopefully will motivate others to share their findings (as PRs). It's as simple as creating a new file in the `examples` folder!
